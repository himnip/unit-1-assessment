// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning 
// Analysis of Requirements 
// Design 
// Implementation 
// Testing and Integration 
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, which basically entails going through what may be a check list of necessary requirements to ensure the functionality of the software."

const design = "The third step for the development of software which tackles the overall look of the software."

const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which it is essentially the process of executing the software to gauge its functionality."

const testingAndIntegration = "The second to last step is to test and break down the software to then find the solution to its bugs, broken code and so forth. Once that is completed another implementation is put into effect."

const maintain = "The very last step to this process is fairly managable of the steps. You ensure that the software is always updated to new, functional code, and to make sure if bugs were to appear they are dealt with in a timely manner."
